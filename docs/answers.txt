4. Branches are used in a Git repository to (1) point to a specific commit,
and (2) is integrated with git checkout and git merge commands.

5. The git log command displays the commit history. The git status command
displays the current conditions of the project.

6. git log Vehile.h

7. git log --grep=file

8. (1) Inheritance dervives a class from an existing class. The existing
class' attributes or methods are shared with the derived class.
(2) Polymorphism occurs when one instance is associated with many forms.
(3) Encapsulation hides or restricts information from an object's data.

9. The Integration Manager Workflow makes push/pull requests based on their own
public repository. The Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow uses one central repository
and has limited access; anyone can make pull requests, but only the dictator can push to it.

10. One reason why a team of 100 developers would benefit from the Dictator and Lieutenants
Workflow instead of the Centralized Workflow is because only certain roles (dictators or lieutenants)
are allowed to merge changes and solve conflicts. This is beneficial for a large team so that
no one will be working on the same issue without them knowing.
